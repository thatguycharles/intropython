# Exercise 1: Introduction to Python for scientific computing

This is the template repository for Biol74.03/Biol177 Exercise 1: Introduction to Python for Scientific Computing. The exercise is contained in the Jupyter (.ipynb) notebook

This exercise was created by Prof. Jeremy Manning as part of his terrific open-course [Introduction to Programming for Psychological Scientists](https://github.com/ContextLab/cs-for-psych).


To begin, open `intro_to_python.ipynb` and click the blue "Open in Colab" button at the top. 

# Saving your notebook

To save your notebook in your own Google Drive account, click File > Save a copy in Drive. To make use of github for version control, you can instead save to your repository of this assignment. To do this, you have to give Colaboratory access to your private repositories on Github:

- Navigate to http://colab.research.google.com/github
- Check the "Include Private Repos" checkbox
- In the popup window, sign into your github acount and authorize Colab to read private files. 

To submit your updated notebook, click File > save a copy in Github, and select the corresponding repository in the dropdown menu (`CompModNervSystem/CompModNervSys-IntroPython`). Make sure that the "Include a link to Colaboratory" box is checked.
